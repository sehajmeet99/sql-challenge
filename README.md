A folder of the 6 .csv files used for this project.
A .png image of the Entity Relationship Diagram relating each of the 6 aforementioned files to each other.
An employee_schema.sql file used to build the tables on a local Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).
An employee_analysis.sql file used to manipulate the imported tables and answer questions about the data.
The employee_schema.sql file used to build the tables on a local Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) first designs the tables to hold data in the CSVs, 
then imports the CSVs into a SQL database, and answers questions about the data.
